        Once a devoted Light Paladin, Caelan’s fate changed when his sacred armor was touched by the void-hand of an Enderman while saving the Starfinder heir. Though his intentions were noble, the corruption left its mark. Shunned by his father and branded “Dark Paladin,” Caelan rose from loss and disgrace to become the resolute leader of the Vanguards. Beneath the obsidian steel and cold stare lies a protector who shoulders the weight of every soul he cannot save.

      <p class="text-gray-200 leading-relaxed text-base md:text-lg">
        The Vanguards are led by Dark Paladin Caelan, who was once a devoted paladin of the sun, once saved the heir of The Starfinders, and doing so his armor was touched by an enderman, because of this his armor turned black. His father named him Dark Paladin as a shaming tactic. But nowadays Caelan is the leader of The Vanguards, and takes pride in protecting the Starfinders faction with his people.

      <p class="text-gray-200 leading-relaxed text-base md:text-lg">
        His people are nowadays found wandering the lands, making it a better place by killing the monsters that spawn in the world during the night. When they return back they are requested to take at least one head of a monster with them to add to The Wall of Skulls. A wall littered with the heads of monsters that wanted to attack people.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-200 leading-relaxed text-base md:text-lg">
        Some people call The Vanguards aggressive brutes without knowing them at all, they are however strong fighters, with swords enchanted with The Dark Crystal by Caelan Duskbane. These blades deal extra damage to the undead, making sure that people are protected when they go outside of the walls of the city of Aerlehn.
